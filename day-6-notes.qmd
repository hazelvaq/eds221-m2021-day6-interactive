## Warm up:

```{r}
book_vector <- c("brown bear", "red bird", "yellow duck", "blue horse")

for(i in 1:(length(book_vector)-1)){
  print(paste0(book_vector[i],", ",book_vector[i],", what do you see?", " I see a ", book_vector[i+1], " looking at me"))
}
```

### How to "tidy data"

```{r}
dogs <- data.frame(dog_name = c("teddy","khora"), week_1 = c(20,17), week_2 = c(21,24), week_3 = c(18,25))

## pivot_longer

library(tidyr)

dogs_longer <- dogs %>% tidyr::pivot_longer(week_1:week_3,names_to = "week", values_to = "miles")

dogs_longer
```
